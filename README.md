# ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Controller Using Verilog

## Overview  
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) to control a traffic light system. The design simulates the operation of a single-road signal system with three lights: Red, Green, and Yellow. The controller cycles through these lights with fixed timing intervals. The project includes a comprehensive testbench to verify the FSM's behavior under various timing scenarios, with waveform generation for debugging.  
- For this project we are using a **Moore Model**.

## Access Project at EDAPlayground  
Visit the [EDA Playground link](https://edaplayground.com/x/iN2U) to directly access the code.

## Project Structure  
- **Design File**: `traffic_light_controller.v`  
  - Contains the main module `traffic_light_controller`, which implements the FSM.
- **Testbench File**: `tb_traffic_light_controller.v`  
  - Contains the testbench module `tb_traffic_light_controller`, which tests the design under multiple timing scenarios and generates a VCD file for waveform viewing.
- **Timescale**: ``timescale 10ns / 1ps``  
  - Time unit: 10 ns (10,000 ps), precision: 1 ps.

## State Diagram  
The state diagram visually represents the **finite state machine (FSM)** controlling the traffic light. Each state corresponds to a **specific light phase**, and **transitions occur** based on a timing counter. By examining the diagram, one can easily understand the flow of operations and the logic behind each transition.

## Module Description

### `traffic_light_controller`  
- **Purpose**: Controls a traffic light system using an FSM with fixed timing intervals.

- **Inputs**:

| Signal   | Description                             |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `clk`    | Clock signal for synchronous operation  |
| `reset`  | Active-high reset to initialize the FSM |

- **Outputs**:

| Signal   | Description                             |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `red`    | Red light ON when in RED state          |
| `yellow` | Yellow light ON when in YELLOW state    |
| `green`  | Green light ON when in GREEN state      |

- **States**:

| State         | Code   | Description                      |
|---------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| `RED_STATE`   | 2'b00  | Red light ON for 5 cycles        |
| `GREEN_STATE` | 2'b01  | Green light ON for 5 cycles      |
| `YELLOW_STATE`| 2'b10  | Yellow light ON for 2 cycles     |

### `tb_traffic_light_controller`  
- **Purpose**: Tests the `traffic_light_controller` module under various timing scenarios.

- **Features**:
  - Generates a VCD file (`traffic_light.vcd`) for waveform viewing.
  - Monitors internal state (`current_state`) and all outputs.
  - Tests multiple timing transitions and reset behavior.

- **Test Cases**:
  1. **Normal Cycle**: RED â†’ GREEN â†’ YELLOW â†’ RED, with correct timing intervals.
  2. **Reset During RED**: Reset asserted during RED state, FSM returns to RED.
  3. **Reset During GREEN**: Reset asserted during GREEN state, FSM returns to RED.
  4. **Reset During YELLOW**: Reset asserted during YELLOW state, FSM returns to RED.
  5. **Multiple Cycles**: FSM completes multiple full cycles with correct light transitions.

## Waveform  
The following is a reference waveform generated from the `tb_traffic_light_controller` testbench using Siemens QuestaSim on EDA Playground. It shows the behavior of all signals and the internal state (`current_state`) across the test cases.

## Analyze Waveforms  
- Verify key events:
  - **Test Case 1**: Observe RED â†’ GREEN â†’ YELLOW â†’ RED transitions every few clock cycles.
  - **Test Case 2â€“4**: FSM resets to RED state regardless of current state.
  - **Test Case 5**: FSM completes multiple cycles with correct timing.

- Use EPWaveâ€™s time axis (set to ps) to zoom into specific transitions and verify light durations.

## Usage  
- Clone or download this repository.
- Open EDA Playground via the provided [link](https://edaplayground.com/x/iN2U) or upload the Verilog files.
- Follow the simulation steps above to run and analyze the testbench.
- Use the waveform viewer to debug state transitions and output behavior.

## Notes  
- The design assumes a 10 ns clock period (5 ns high, 5 ns low).
- The testbench is designed to be comprehensive, covering normal operation and reset conditions.
- For further customization, modify the testbench delays or add new test cases in `tb_traffic_light_controller`.
